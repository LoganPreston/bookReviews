# bookReviews

This app will take an input file (currently hardcoded) and parse each book|author combination using google books. Concurrent requests so it is rate limited to avoid https 427 errors. Writes an output file with the book, author, review score, and number of reviews (file out is also hardcoded for now)

Wrote it to try to prioritize what I read next.
